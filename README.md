# voronoi
just a little experiment using D3 Voronoi and dat.GUI to understand how to handle these libraries, it was not meant to be original. entirely based on the follow experiments:
- [Mike Bostock - Rotating Voronoi](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4636377)
- [Mike Bostock - Voronoi Tesselation](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4060366)
- [Mike Bostock - Circle Dragging IV](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/ec10387f24c1fad2acac3bc11eb218a5)
